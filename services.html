                                process is to clean the facade and windows with the clean-watern method.<br><br></li>

                            <p><strong>KTV Working Drone evolved out of the KTV Group which was founded in 1992 by
                                    Kennet Nilsen. KTV Group have
                                    more than 30 years experience with facade and window cleaning and are experts in
                                    their field.</strong></p>
                            <p>KTV Working Drone originated from an idea to find an innovative and efficient way to
                                clean facades and windows.
                                This was back in 2015. A lot of mods were needed to make the drone work properly for
                                cleaning, also commercial.
                                Fast forward the result is a unique drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted
                                mounting equipment with
                                specially designed cleaning equipment. A patent pending safety solution to prevent
                                the drone from falling down
                                during operation is also developed.</p>
                            <p>The drone has been extensively tested and commercialized for window and facade
                                cleaning, and has been used
                                operationally since 2020 by the KTV Group in Norway.</p>
                            <p>In 2022, KTV Working Drone was ready and the commercialising process started. Today
                                KTV Working Drone is
                                established almost all over the world, and the partner network is growing rapidly.
                            </p>
                            <p>The future holds many opportunities for development for KTV Working Drone. We think
