                            <p>KTV Working Drone originated from an idea to find an innovative and efficient way to
                                clean facades and windows.
                                This was back in 2015. A lot of mods were needed to make the drone work properly for
                                cleaning, also commercial.
                                Fast forward the result is a unique drone with tailor-made and uniquely adapted
                                mounting equipment with
                                specially designed cleaning equipment. A patent pending safety solution to prevent
                                the drone from falling down
                                during operation is also developed.</p>
                            <p>The drone has been extensively tested and commercialized for window and facade
                                cleaning, and has been used
                                operationally since 2020 by the KTV Group in Norway.</p>
                            <p>In 2022, KTV Working Drone was ready and the commercialising process started. Today
                                KTV Working Drone is
                                established almost all over the world, and the partner network is growing rapidly.
                            </p>
                            <p>The future holds many opportunities for development for KTV Working Drone. We think
                                our drones soon will be able
                                to do small repairs, special inspections and even surface treatment.</p>
